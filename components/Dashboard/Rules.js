                    promote the image of our fan server to provide a safe and comfortable environment for people who are new to Hololive.

                        NSFW images will result in a warning or ban depending on the image and the actions taken during the time of posting.

                        it's preferred to keep them on #‚ñ∑-hololive-discussion as long as they're Hololive related topics.<br/>
